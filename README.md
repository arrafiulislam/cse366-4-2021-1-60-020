# Assignment 1: Dynamic Robot Movement Simulation
This repository contains Python code for simulating robot movement through a dynamically created grid environment. The simulation includes implementations of Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A* search algorithms for pathfinding.


## Overview

The code consists of the following components:

- `Environment`: Class for generating a grid environment with obstacles, a start position, and an end position.
- `Agent`: Class representing the robot agent, which utilizes UCS and A* algorithms for navigation.
- `PriorityQueue`: Class for managing priority queues used in search algorithms.
- `Node`: Class representing nodes in the search tree.
- Visualization functions: Functions for visualizing the grid, obstacles, paths, and battery levels over time.


#Deliverables
GitHub Project Submission with a structured repository containing:
 -Jupyter notebook
 -Detailed report 
 -README.md files providing an overview and instructions for running the simulation
